# NLP-Disaster-Tweets-Classification
This is a repository for the source code of the disaster tweets classification using NLP project found on https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/nlp-getting-started/  

This project is implemented using Python 3.8.5, CUDA 11.6.  
There are two experiments have been done to classify disaster tweets.  
1) Imlementation of a statistical learning model such as.  
2) Implementation of a neural network such as BERT.
